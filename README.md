# GameEA
1)This is a novel game theory-inspired evolutionary optimization algorithm(GameEA) for solving optimization problems. GameEA has a single population (player set) and generates new offsprings only by the imitation operator and the belief learning operator. The imitation operator is used to learn strategies and actions from other more competitive players, in which an individual updates its chromosome by copying some gene segments from the competitor. Belief learning operator allows an individual to adjust its strategies, behavior or chromosome by analyzing current history information for improving solution quality.


2)C++ language and VS 2013 were employed to implement GameEA.

3)Fun.cfg is the popsize  and max generation, and FunResults store the output results, and the file of .fitness is the fitness, and the file of .txt is the final optimal results
